* Notes
The nullability experiment doesn't work as expected yet. It didn't
appear to be possible to compile the test suite in a way that includes
the nullability compilation flag.

* Tasks
** TODO Parse Date
** DONE Add travis badge
** DONE Add readme
** DONE Add License
** TODO Add second date
** TODO Parse Amount
into string currency and string value
** DONE Parse Account
** TODO Split into different files
** TODO Determine behaviour on null description
** TODO Add support for account declarations
=account Foo:Bar=
** TODO Attempt to re-enable nullable experiment
** TODO Parse amount value
Allow for different locales, etc.

** TODO Find out what happens when more than one line has =null= amount
** TODO Add balance method to transaction class
** TODO Add balance assertions
Should the balance assertion be part of a transaction line, or should
the parser spit it out as a separate assertion element in the list of
transactions/parse results?
** TODO Add serialisation
** TODO Consider adding position information to parse result
The idea is that a client can navigate to the corresponding
information in the file and excise/manipulate it easily without having
to re-render the entire file.
** TODO Publish on pub.dev
