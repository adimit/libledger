* Notes
The nullability experiment doesn't work as expected yet. It didn't
appear to be possible to compile the test suite in a way that includes
the nullability compilation flag.

* Tasks
** TODO Parse Date
** TODO Add travis badge
** TODO Parse Amount
** TODO Parse Account
** TODO Split into different files
** TODO Determine behaviour on null description
** TODO Add support for account declarations
** TODO Add balance method to transaction class
** TODO Attempt to re-enable nullable experiment
** TODO Consider adding position information to parse result
The idea is that a client can navigate to the corresponding
information in the file and excise/manipulate it easily without having
to re-render the entire file.

** TODO Add serialisation
** TODO Publish on pub.dev
